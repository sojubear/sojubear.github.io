# Who am I?

Hey, I’m Sojubear! I spent over a decade in military intel before pivoting to cybersecurity. Now, I get to hunt threats and break stuff for a living.

This blog is pretty much my public notebook. You’ll find a mix of my latest cybersecurity rabbit holes, no fluff reviews of certs and courses, and the occasional post on what it’s really like working in this field.
