# Exploring Russia's Disinformation Campaigns

## Introduction

What is a disinformation campaign? In simple words, it's a targeted information attack on an individual or organization. Purposefully misleading information is published using various channels such as social media and fake news websites to twist public opinion, undermine trust and ultimately achieve political/economic objectives.

One interesting concept that originated from the Russian government is the use of "Kompromat" which comes from "Compromising Material". It goes back to the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs and to the Stalin era. It relies on gathering sensitive information that could ruin the reputation or discredit the actions of individuals and organizations.

This article will discuss significant Russian disinformation campaigns throughout the years and show how they have swayed public perception.

## Key Events in Russian Disinformation Campaigns

### 1980s Operation INFEKTION aka Operation Denver

Operation Denver was a KGB-led disinformation campaign in the 1980s aimed at convincing the world that the US had created HIV/AIDS as a biological weapon and were conducting their tests in Africa. The narrative was spread by planting stories in international media, such as the pro-Soviet newspaper "Patriot" and other methods such as by funding different radio programs and wooing journalists to publish these false stories.

As a result, US lost some credibility and there was an increase in anti-American sentiments. The Soviet Union also managed to divert attention from their own biological warfare program as during the same period, they were developing and weaponizing resistant strains of plague, anthrax etc. The false narrative was spread over 80 countries and ended up straining international relations.

### 1998 Skuratov Affair

In 1998, Russian Prosecutor-General Yuri Skuratov began investigating the Mabetex Group, a company accused of bribing the Yeltsin family in exchange for a $1.5 billion contract to renovate Kremlin properties. As the investigation gained momentum, Vladimir Putin, then head of the FSB, used kompromat to discredit Skuratov. A low resolution video subsequently was aired on Russian television showing someone that resembles Skuratov with two prostitutes. Putin confirmed the man as Skuratov, which led to his forced resignation.

This classic case of kompromat shows how political agendas can be achieved using misleading information and also displays Putin's willingness to use such tactics to gain political power.

### 1999 Apartment Bombings

In September 1999, multiple bombings killed over 300 people and injured more than 1,000 in Russia. It ended up being one of the triggers for the Second Chechen War. Vladimir Putin, then relatively unknown, handled the crisis and rallied the Russian population, significantly boosting his popularity. On September 13, the Chairman of the State Duma, Gennadiy Seleznyov, prematurely announced a bombing in Volgodonsk, but the attack only took place three days later. Chechen militants were blamed for this attack, but they denied responsibility. On September 22, a suspicious device was found and defused in Ryazan, leading to the arrest of two FSB agents. Then FSB director Nikolay Patruschev announced that the events in Ryazan were part of an anti-terrorism drill and both agents were shortly released. Many believe that this was a false flag operation to justify the attack on the Chechens and to enhance Putin's political standing.

Although this was not directly a disinformation campaign, it shows how the strategic use of terrorism and false narratives were used to achieve political goals. It also raises very serious questions about the role of state security in launching such attacks against its own country.

### 2008 Georgia Conflict

During the buildup towards the Russo-Georgian War, false narratives were spread regarding Georgia's aggression towards Russia. Unverified claims of killings on Russian peacekeepers and civilians were spread to incite strong emotional reactions from the global population and justify Russian military "peace enforcement" actions against Georgia. Domestically, Georgian media outlets were targeted with a series of false narratives and cyber attacks against their communication networks.

There were many reasons for Russia's actions and aggression towards Georgia. One of them being due to Georgia's increasing ties and possible membership with NATO. Russia viewed this as western encroachment over former Soviet territories and deemed it a threat to their sphere of influence.

### 2014 Ukraine Crisis

Following the fall of the pro-Russian, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU) conducted a covert influence operation to destabilize the new Ukrainian government and justify the annexation of Crimea. Sock puppets, social media groups and paid ads were used to spread disinformation, showing that pro-Western demonstrators were fascists and incited fear among pro-Russian citizens. False narratives also promoted the Crimean secession under the guise of a Nazi threat.

Crimea has long been of strategic interest to Russia due to most of its population being Russian-speaking and most importantly the city of Sevastopol, which houses its Black Sea Fleet. Russia saw the new Ukrainian government as pro-Western and moved quickly to secure their interests in Crimea. The campaign aimed to undermine Ukraine's stability and legitimize Russia's actions in Crimea.

### 2016 Russian Interference in the US Elections aka Project Lakhta

Russian interference in the 2016 US Elections were conducted primarily by the Internet Research Agency (IRA) aka the "Troll Factory", a Russian company which focused on pro-Russian propaganda and influence operations alongside the GRU.

The IRA conducted a large scale social media disinformation campaign, creating thousands of fake accounts and masqueraded as American citizens. Divisive issues were raised such as race, immigration and gun rights, which aimed to widen the gap between the US population and ultimately influence voter behavior.

Meanwhile, the GRU hacked into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and compromised the email accounts of key political figures such as Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. Clinton's campaign was damaged after the stolen emails were released through platforms like DCleaks and WikiLeaks and public opinion was swayed towards Donald Trump.

Ultimately, Russia managed to achieve its agenda by creating a political divide between US citizens and also ensuring that Donald Trump won the 2016 elections.

### 2024 Russian Disinformation Campaign against Biden

In March 2024, there were claims that a Ukrainian troll farm was targeting the US elections on behalf of Joe Biden. The video showed a woman who mentioned that after a visit from suspected CIA agents, the troll farm switched their operations from supporting Ukrainian Presentient Zelensky to undermining Donald Trump.

The video, however, was discovered to be a fake, designed to confuse and mislead. US officials identified the video as part of a Russian disinformation campaign. It was said to be attributed to Storm-1516, a group linked to Russian disinformation efforts.

The disinformation tactics reflect a classic Russian strategy: accuse your adversary of the very actions you are undertaking. By claiming that a Ukrainian troll farm is manipulating the US election, Russia is, in reality, distracting everyone else from its own interference efforts.

## Takeaways of Modern Disinformation Campaigns

In the past, disinformation tactics such as physically doctored photographs, planted drugs, and low resolution videos showing illicit activities were used to ruin the reputation of individuals/organizations and ultimately discrediting them. Today, campaigns use more high tech methods such as hacking emails and digitally manipulated videos. There is also a heavy use of social media manipulation, fake news, troll farms and cyber operations.

Although not talked about, I believe that there will be an increase in the usage of AI to generate false yet highly realistic content and such narratives will be amplified across social media. A large number of chatbots will conduct automated engagement with real users such as posting on social media and responding to user comments to give the illusion of agreement or controversy depending on the agenda.

## Impact

### Political Polarization

Disinformation campaigns have intensified political polarization, making it harder and harder for societies to reach an agreement on key issues. By targeting divisive topics and amplifying controversial viewpoints, these campaigns deepen societal rifts. This polarization undermines democratic processes, making governing a population more challenging.

### Erosion of Trust in Institutions

Persistent disinformation campaigns weaken public trust in governments and the media. As people grow skeptical of official narratives and traditional sources of information, it becomes harder to maintain a unified societal response to issues. This skepticism can lead to increased reliance on alternative, often unreliable sources, further complicating efforts to address misinformation.

### Strain on International Relations

The strategic use of disinformation as a tool of statecraft has strained international relations, resulting in diplomatic conflicts. Countries targeted by these campaigns often face increased tensions with other states and often experience economic or political repercussions. The resulting atmosphere of distrust hampers international cooperation and complicates efforts to collaboratively address global challenges.

## Conclusion

The events mentioned in this article shows how Russia launches its disinformation campaigns to further progress the Kremlin's political and economic agendas. By understanding how these campaigns are conducted, we will hopefully be able to better identify and validate false narratives.
