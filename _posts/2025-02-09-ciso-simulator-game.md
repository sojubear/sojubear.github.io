# Cybersecurity Burnout Simulator - A Game for Awareness

I recently built an interactive web-based game that simulates the challenges of being a Chief Information Security Officer. The game aims to raise awareness about mental health in cybersecurity while providing an engaging and educational experience.

## The Problem

Working in cybersecurity can be incredibly rewarding, but it's also one of the most stressful fields in tech. The constant pressure of protecting organizations from evolving threats, managing tight budgets, and dealing with the aftermath of incidents can lead to serious burnout. I wanted to create something that could help people understand these challenges while also being educational.

## The Solution

The Cybersecurity Burnout Simulator puts players in the shoes of a cybersecurity professional, experiencing the daily challenges, pressures, and decisions that can lead to burnout in the industry. Players choose their role and face different scenarios that mirror real-world situations.
